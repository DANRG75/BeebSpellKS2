DANRG75 KS2 Spelling Test for the BBC Micro
-------------------------------------------

A simple spelling test for the BBC Micro based on the National Curriculum KS2 (Junior School) wordlists that cover "tricky words" that follow non-standard patterns.

The programme follows the familiar Read, Cover, Write methodology, and is an un-timed test (often the challenge of finding the right letter on the keyboard is harder than the actual spelling of the word) of ten words.

FILES:
------

README - this file
spelling-test - the BBC Basic source code
spell.dsd - A BBC disk image containing the Basic programme and a !BOOT file


spell.dsd should boot normally with shift-break else once the disk is loaded into the BBC, type:

CH."TEST"

TO-DO:
------

While the programme does work, it could do with some improvement:

Fail silently - currently the programme repeats input error with a 'no' this should instead just record the end results.

Results - currently just remarks X/10 correct, should produce list of words input incorrectly with encouraging remarks to practice more.

Test again - the end of the programme is inelegant and dumps the user back at basic prompt >

Select word list - Years 3 & 4 only need the first 110 words, whereas Y 5 & 6 are expected the whole 217 - user should be able to choose.
